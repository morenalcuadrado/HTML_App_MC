            <section>
                <!-- A little history of her -->
                <p>Was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867, the daughter of a
                    secondary-school teacher. She received a general education
                    in local schools and some scientific training from her
                    father. She became involved in a studentsZ revolutionary
                    organization and found it prudent to leave Warsaw, then in
                    the part of Poland dominated by Russia, for Cracow, which at
                    that time was under Austrian rule. In 1891, she went to
                    Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she
                    obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical
                    Sciences. More history?
